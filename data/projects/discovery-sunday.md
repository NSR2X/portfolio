# Overview:
These brands were created to be a platform promoting new and upcoming artists, allowing them to upload their music and get feedback from the community, via a Web radio and a mobile App (Discovery-Sounds/PLUR Radio), but also a record label (Sunday-Records) for artists that were ready to be signed.

It really was a fun project, and finding these underground artists was really cool when able to sign them to the record label, the overall apps had been running for a few years, but the project was officially discontinued in 2022, being too time-consuming for little revenue.
Passion can't only be a pain in the ass.. :)
